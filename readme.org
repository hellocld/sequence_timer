* Sequence Timer

A little sequenced timer tool thing made in Godot.

** What?

While trying to spin up a new habit requiring a number of smaller exercises one after another, I realized I could use a set of timers that would fire off one after the other. This little tool is the result of my initial work on creating such a thing. It allows for

- The creation of new timers in a sequence
- Saving and loading timer sets
- Running the timers in sequence, complete with a little beep to let you know when one timer has completed.

** Todo

- [ ] Add "duplicate timer" functionality
- [ ] Add a "clear timer set" option for starting from scratch
- [ ] Allow for the editing of individual timers
- [ ] Add timer rearrangement functionality
- [X] Better start/pause/stop/next/previous button implementation
